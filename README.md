Currently unfinished Asset Management System built with Laravel 4.2. I've been writing for my employer and have been given permission to open source. 

Planned features include barcode generation integration, dynamic tag generation based on category prefix specified by the user, and of course a login system.

This is my first project with laravel so I've still got some things to figure out, but so far I've really enjoyed working with the framework. I've tried to follow good REST practices though some paths may need refined. 

Front end is mostly Bootstrap.
